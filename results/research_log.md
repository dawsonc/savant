+ Ran `experiment.py` with to test the pure time series approach with all possible combinations of:
    * Hidden Layer Size: [1, 3, 10, 30, 100, 300]
    * Regularization: [0, 1, 3, 10, 30, 100, 300, 1000]
    * Number of previous days to use in time series: [1, 3, 10, 30, 100]
+ Determined best (least cross-validation error) combination to be:
    * Hidden Layer Size:
    * Regularization:
    * Number of previous days to use in time series:
